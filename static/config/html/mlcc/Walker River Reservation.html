The land base consists of about 325,000 acres in a river valley, mostly used for grazing and some ranching. The present Reservation encompasses a high desert land base and is surrounded by mountains, desert lakes, and marshland/wetlands. The current Reservation was a traditional wintering grounds for the Walker River Paiute Numu (people) due to the mild winters. The Numu (people) then migrated back to the Sierras for summer camps. The riparian areas of the Reservation have mostly been converted to farm land with alfalfa being the major crop. The only town on the Reservation is Schurz, Nevada where the intersection of U.S. Highway 95 and 95-A (major routes running north and south) meet. Fallon, Nevada is 39 miles North, Yerington, Nevada is 25 miles West and Hawthorne, Nevada is 33 miles to the South. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.wrpt.us/ target='_blank'>http://www.wrpt.us/</a></td></tr></table></div>
