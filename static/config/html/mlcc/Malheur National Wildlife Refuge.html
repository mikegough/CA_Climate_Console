Roosevelt set aside unclaimed government lands encompassed by Malheur, Mud and Harney Lakes  as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds.  The newly established  Lake Malheur Reservation  was the 19th of 51 wildlife refuges created by Roosevelt during his tenure as president. At the time, Malheur was the third refuge in Oregon and one of only six refuges west of the Mississippi.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/malheur/ target='_blank'>http://www.fws.gov/refuge/malheur/</a></td></tr></table></div>
