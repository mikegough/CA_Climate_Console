Today, the Refuge preserves both habitat for wildlife, and evidence of the people who once lived here. Along the lower reaches of the Columbia River lies the Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The approximately 5300 acres contain a lush mixture of wetlands, grasslands, riparian corridors, and forests. These habitats, combined with a mild and rainy winter climate, provide the ideal environment for many species including neotropical song birds, wintering waterfowl, and other local native species. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ridgefield/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ridgefield/</a></td></tr></table></div>
