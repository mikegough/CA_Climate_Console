During the spring and fall migrations, thousands of birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway flock to the refuge, seeking shelter and food in one of the few remaining wetlands along the central California coast.  Salinas River National Wildlife Refuge also protects several threatened and endangered species, including Western snowy plover, Smith s blue butterfly, and Monterey spineflower.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/salinas_river/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/salinas_river/</a></td></tr></table></div>
