The rugged Centennial Mountains, rising  to more than 10,000 feet, provide a dramatic backdrop for this extremely remote Refuge in Southwest Montana's Centennial Valley. Red Rock Lakes NWR encompasses primarily high mountain, wetland-riparian habitat--the largest in the Greater Yellowstone Area-- and is located near the headwaters of the Missouri River. Several creeks flow into the refuge, creating the impressive Upper Red Rock Lake, River Marsh, and Lower Red Rock Lake. The snows of winter replenish the refuge s lakes and wetlands that provide secluded habitat for many wetland birds, including the trumpeter swan, white-faced ibis, and black-crowned night herons. The Refuge also includes wet meadows, willow riparian, grasslands, and forest habitats. This diversity provides habitat for other species such as sandhill cranes, long-billed curlews, peregrine falcons, eagles, hawks, moose, badgers, bears, wolves, pronghorns and native fish such as Arctic grayling and westslope cutthroat trout. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_rock_lakes/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_rock_lakes/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Red_Rock_Lakes/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Red_Rock_Lakes/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
