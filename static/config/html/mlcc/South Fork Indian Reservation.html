The reservation sits on rugged high desert terrain typical of northern Nevada and Utah. It is located just west of the Humboldt National Forest and in the foothills of the Ruby Mountains. The South Fork Reservation was established by Executive Order in 1941 under the provisions of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. Land purchases between 1937 and 1939, totaling 9,500 acres, were put toward the newly established band's land base. Subsequent land purchases brought the Reservation to its present size.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.temoaktribe.com/southfork.shtml target='_blank'>http://www.temoaktribe.com/southfork.shtml</a></td></tr></table></div>
