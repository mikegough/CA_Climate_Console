The Yomba Indian Reservation contains approximately 4,681 acres of land located within the upper Reese River Valley of Nye County, Nevada. The lands now comprising the Yomba Indian Reservation were assimilated between July 1937 and February 1941 from a series of four separate ranch acquisitions including the Bowler Ranch, Doyle (Bolster) Ranch, Dieringer Ranch and the Worthington Ranch. The Upper Reese River and its tributaries provide irrigation water for each of these ranch areas, as well as the intervening, non-tribally owned ranches. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.yombatribe.org/ target='_blank'>http://www.yombatribe.org/</a></td></tr></table></div>
