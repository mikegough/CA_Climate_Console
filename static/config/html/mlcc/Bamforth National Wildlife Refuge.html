The Refuge is not posted, fenced, or signed to indicate its status as a national wildlife refuge because it consists of three separated sections, each surrounded by non-federal lands.  Access to these areas is limited and Bamforth NWR is not open for public use at this time to avoid possible trespass issues.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bamforth/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bamforth/</a></td></tr></table></div>
