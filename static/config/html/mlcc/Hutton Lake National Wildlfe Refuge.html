The Refuge is managed as part of the Arapaho National Wildlife Refuge Complex.  It is situated in the southern part of the Laramie plain; a high elevation, dry grassland surrounded by mountains.  The shallow depressions of the basin, within the relatively flat topography of the region, support wetland complexes, including marsh and lakes, that are unique to the semiarid area.  The Refuge sits at an elevation of 7,150 feet and has five small lakes on it - Hutton, Creighton, George, Rush and Hoge.  The upland vegetation consists of short grasses and sagebrush.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hutton_lake/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hutton_lake/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Hutton_Lake/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Hutton_Lake/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
