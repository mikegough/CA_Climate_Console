Comprised of five units three in Washington and two in Oregon the refuge's 23,555 acres offer a broad collection of habitats, and thus species. Natural and managed wetlands, mixed with native shrub-steppe, provide homes for an abundance of Columbia Basin species. The wildlife, in turn, attracts visitors, hunters, anglers and birdwatchers. The refuge is well-known for its waterfowl hunting opportunities, and those same waterfowl, along with scores of species of waterbirds, passerines and mule deer, draw visitors from around the Northwest and beyond.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/umatilla/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/umatilla/</a></td></tr></table></div>
