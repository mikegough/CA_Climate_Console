The Refuge's boundaries have been modified several times since it's establishment.  In 1936 Executive Order 7425 established the present Refuge ""as a refuge and breeding ground for birds and other wildlife"". Its major habitats of open water wetlands, uplands consisting of shrub and grasslands and alkali flats support a diversity of wildlife.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/pathfinder/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/pathfinder/</a></td></tr></table></div>
