After the United States reinstituted federal recognition to the Tribe and restored its full sovereignty rights in 1989, the Coquille Tribal government created an administrative program that now provides housing, health care, education, elder care, law enforcement and judicial services to its members. The Tribe is the second largest employer in Coos County, Oregon, with successful business ventures in forestry, arts and exhibits, gaming and hospitality, high-speed telecommunications and renewable energy. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.coquilletribe.org/ target='_blank'>http://www.coquilletribe.org/</a></td></tr></table></div>
