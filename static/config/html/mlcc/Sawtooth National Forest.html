We hope you will take the time to learn about this ""working/producing"" National Forest. Managing and protecting your land is most challenging - not only because of the vastness of this land, but because of the varied, and sometimes conflicting, interests and values that you the owners of this land hold near and dear. Managing and protecting this land, for today and as well as future generations, means listening and working with other agencies, implementing the laws mandated by Congress, exercising our best professional judgment and working with you, the shareholders of this National Forest. We sincerely hope that you will always feel free to question what and how we are doing, and more importantly become involved in our processes as we plan and make decisions regarding the management of this National Forest. We are the stewards of your land - a job that we take a great deal of pride and satisfaction in. If at any time there is anything we can do to help make your time here more enjoyable our employees are here to serve you.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/sawtooth target='_blank'>http://www.fs.usda.gov/sawtooth</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sawtooth/landmanagement/planning/?cid=stelprdb5194854 target='_blank'>http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/sawtooth/landmanagement/planning/?cid=stelprdb5194854</a></td></tr></table></div>
