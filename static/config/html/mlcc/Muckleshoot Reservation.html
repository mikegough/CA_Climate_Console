The Tribe s name is derived from the native name for the prairie on which the Muckleshoot Reservation was established.  Following the Reservation s establishment in 1857, the Tribe and its members came to be known as Muckleshoot, rather than by the historic tribal names of their Duwamish and Upper Puyallup ancestors.  Today, the United States recognizes the Muckleshoot Tribe as a tribal successor to the Duwamish and Upper Puyallup bands from which the Tribe s membership descends.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.muckleshoot.nsn.us/ target='_blank'>http://www.muckleshoot.nsn.us/</a></td></tr></table></div>
