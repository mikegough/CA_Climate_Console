Over 78% of the area around the lake is public land managed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service. Totaling over 154,000 acres, this land includes beaches, hiking and biking trails, wilderness, historic estates and developed recreation areas such as campgrounds and riding stables. The forest is managed to provide access for the public and to protect the natural resources of the area. We hope you will join us in ensuring that the lake and surrounding lands will be even more beautiful and healthy in the future than they are now.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/ltbmu/ target='_blank'>http://www.fs.usda.gov/ltbmu/</a></td></tr></table></div>
