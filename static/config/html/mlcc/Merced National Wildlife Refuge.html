It was established in 1951 under the Lea Act to attract wintering waterfowl from adjacent farmland where their foraging activities were causing crop damage. In the last few decades, changes in local agricultural practices and Refuge management activities have reduced these wildlife/crop issues.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'>N/A</td></tr></table></div>
