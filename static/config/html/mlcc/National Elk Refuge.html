Although the Fish and Wildlife Service shares this responsibility with other federal, state, tribal, local, and private entities, it has specific trust responsibilities for migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, and certain anadromous fish and marine mammals. The Fish and Wildlife Service also has similar trust responsibilities for the land and waters it administers to support the conservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife. The Fish and Wildlife Service is required to manage the National Elk Refuge to meet refuge purposes and to contribute to the agency's mission-related mandates.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/national_elk_refuge/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/national_elk_refuge/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/nwrs/threecolumn.aspx?id=2147510282 target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/nwrs/threecolumn.aspx?id=2147510282</a></td></tr></table></div>
