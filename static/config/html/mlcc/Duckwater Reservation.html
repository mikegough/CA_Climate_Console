The Tribe is primarily an agricultural community, drawing water from the largest geothermal hot spring located in the State of Nevada. This same hot spring aka the Big Warm Spring is home to the threatened species of the Railroad Valley Spring Fish. The Tribe has done mitigation to the critical habitat for the Railroad Valley Spring Fish in and near the Big Warm Spring; however, the swimming hole is still open to public use. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.duckwatertribe.org/ target='_blank'>http://www.duckwatertribe.org/</a></td></tr></table></div>
