Finley National Wildlife Refuge s primary management goal is to provide wintering habitat for dusky Canada geese. Unlike other Canada goose subspecies, duskies have limited summer and winter ranges. They nest in Alaska s Copper River Delta and winter almost exclusively in the wetlands of the Willamette Valley much of which was drained to provide open fields for agriculture and pasture during the 19th century European settlement.  With the extensive habitat restoration projects at work on all 5,325 acres of the refuge and the 341 acres of its Snag Boat Bend Unit, it makes driving through like taking a step back into the natural history of the Willamette Valley.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/William_L_Finley/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/William_L_Finley/about.html</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/William_L_Finley/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/William_L_Finley/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
