Managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System, Grays Harbor NWR was established in 1990 and is located in the northeast corner of Grays Harbor estuary. It encompasses about 1,500 acres of intertidal mudflats, salt marsh and uplands. In 1996, Grays Harbor Estuary was designated a hemispheric reserve by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network as a site of international significance.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/grays_harbor/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/grays_harbor/</a></td></tr></table></div>
