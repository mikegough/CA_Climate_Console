Its own history and management is as complex as the lands and waters that surround it. Lands within the Refuge boundary were first withdrawn in 1910 for an irrigation reservoir as part of the Flathead Irrigation Project. Executive Order 3503 established the Refuge on this withdrawal in 1921, subject to reservoir uses. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) requested the establishment of Ninepipe NWR and the refuge is located on Trust lands of the CSKT. A 1948 Act of Congress reimbursed the CSKT $400,000 for all past and future uses of certain reservation lands for physical works and facilities of the Flathead Project irrigation and power systems, and for the Ninepipe and Pablo NWRs. The payment included $50,644 for the permanent easement at Ninepipe NWR.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/nine-pipe/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/nine-pipe/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Nine-pipe/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Nine-pipe/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
