The Shoshone National Forest was set aside in 1891 as part of the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve, making the Shoshone the first national forest in the United States. It consists of some 2.4 million acres of varied terrain ranging from sagebrush flats to rugged mountains. The higher mountains are snow-clad most of the year. Immense areas of exposed rock are interspersed with meadows and forests. With Yellowstone National Park on its western border, the Shoshone encompasses the area from the Montana state line south to Lander, Wyoming, and includes portions of the Absaroka, Wind River, and Beartooth Mountains. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/shoshone target='_blank'>http://www.fs.usda.gov/shoshone</a></td></tr></table></div>
