Cold Springs NWR was established primarily to benefit waterfowl and other native birds. However, the 3,102-acre refuge, while small, provides a surprising variety of habitats and abundance of many other wildlife species. The open water on the reservoir attracts large numbers of Canada geese and ducks. Dense riparian areas provide cover for migrating and nesting songbirds. Shrub-steppe areas support coyotes, badgers, ring-necked pheasants, several hawk species and trophy elk and deer, along with dozens of other mammal, reptile and amphibian species.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/cold_springs/ target='_blank'>http://www.fws.gov/refuge/cold_springs/</a></td></tr></table></div>
