The district is criss-crossed with streams and rivers that support sport fishing and contribute to anadromous (sea run) fish stocks vital to commercial fishing. An important mainstay of the local economy is the wood products industry, which acquires timber from both private and federal lands in the region. With Interstate 5 running through the middle of the district, and east-west state highways connecting Crater Lake to the Pacific coast, the Roseburg District draws many tourists to its scenic and recreation attractions. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.blm.gov/or/districts/roseburg/index.php target='_blank'>http://www.blm.gov/or/districts/roseburg/index.php</a></td></tr></table></div>
