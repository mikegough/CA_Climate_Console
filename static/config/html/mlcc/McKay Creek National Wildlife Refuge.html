The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the lands, whereas the water levels are regulated by the BOR. At full pool the refuge consists of 1,300 acres of water and 537 acres of upland. By late September, an average of 250 acres of water remain at minimum pool. The reservoir relies entirely on run-off from the Blue Mountains feeding McKay Creek, so in poor snow years, the water supply can be limited; full pool has usually been reached, but this is a consideration in the face of climate change.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/McKay_Creek/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/McKay_Creek/about.html</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/McKay_Creek/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/McKay_Creek/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
