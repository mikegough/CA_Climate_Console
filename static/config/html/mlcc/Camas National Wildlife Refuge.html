Members of several native tribes passed through the area on a regular basis, and sometimes camped for short periods of time to hunt and gather foods.  The Bannocks, who were found to the south and west of the area, were the most frequent travelers as they went to the meadows near present day Kilgore, ID (northeast of the refuge) to gather the roots of Camas, a staple in the diets of many native tribes in the Northwest.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/camas/ target='_blank'>http://www.fws.gov/refuge/camas/</a></td></tr></table></div>
