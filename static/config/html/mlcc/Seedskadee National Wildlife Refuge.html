The 27,230 acre Refuge protects a mosaic of riparian, wetland, and upland shrub habitats along 36 miles of the Green River in southwest Wyoming.  The riparian corridor of the Green River is an important migration route and nesting area for a wide variety of migratory waterfowl and passerine bird species.  Many insects, big game and small mammals can be found on the Refuge as well as resident and migratory birds.  Refuge lands are also rich in historic and cultural resources.  The area was used by nomadic Indian tribes, fur trappers, and early pioneers.  Hundreds of thousands of pioneers crossed the treacherous Green River on what is now Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge.  The Oregon and Mormon Trails, which cross the refuge, have been designated as National Historic Trails by Congress.  Jim Bridger and others operated ferries on the Green In the 1840's and 1850's.  Diaries of immigrants often mention the crossing on the river and its difficulties.  Ferries were swept away by the strong currents and lives and possessions were lost.  To this day, some of the trails can be traced across the Refuge by their ruts.  </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/seedskadee/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/seedskadee/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Seedskadee/about.aspx target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Seedskadee/about.aspx</a></td></tr></table></div>
