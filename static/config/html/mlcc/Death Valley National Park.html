It's known for Titus Canyon, with a ghost town and colorful rocks, and Badwater Basin's salt flats, North America's lowest point. Above, Telescope Peak Trail weaves past pine trees. North of the spiky salt mounds known as the Devil's Golf Course, rattlesnakes live in Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. Near Nevada is the Spanish-style mansion Scotty's Castle. In this below-sea-level basin, steady drought and record summer heat make Death Valley a land of extremes. Yet, each extreme has a striking contrast. Towering peaks are frosted with winter snow. Rare rainstorms bring vast fields of wildflowers. Lush oases harbor tiny fish and refuge for wildlife and humans. Despite its morbid name, a great diversity of life survives in Death Valley. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm target='_blank'>https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm</a></td></tr></table></div>
