When the second powerhouse at Bonneville Dam was constructed in the late 70s and early 80s, lowland habitat was lost both up and downstream. In 1987, a portion of these Refuge lands were established to reduce the impact of this loss and create more habitat for migrating and resident wildlife. Since then smaller pieces of land have been added to create what is now the Steigerwald Lake NWR. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Steigerwald_Lake/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Steigerwald_Lake/about.html</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Steigerwald_Lake/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Steigerwald_Lake/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
