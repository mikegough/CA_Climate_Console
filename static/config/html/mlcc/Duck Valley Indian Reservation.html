Established by Executive order on April 16, 1877, the site for this reservation was selected by Captain Sam, a Shoshone leader who felt that the plentiful wild game, anadromous fish, wild berries, abundant water and the fertile valley soil held a promising future for our people.  In 1886 and again in 1910 additional land was annexed to the Reservation to provide for the Shoshone-Paiute peoples,who later came here from the nearby areas to live. Today approximately 2,300 Shoshone-Paiute hold membership at Duck Valley.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://shopaitribes.org/spt-15/ target='_blank'>http://shopaitribes.org/spt-15/</a></td></tr></table></div>
