Historically, the area of the refuge was known as the Colusa Plains which was a vacant, windswept plain with short grasses, shrubs and forbs. In January 1937, the federal government purchased 10,775-acre Spalding Ranch and christened it the Sacramento Migratory Waterfowl Refuge. From 1937-1942 the Civilian Conservation Corp's (CCC) ""Camp Sacramento"" housed up to 200 men at the current headquarters area. The men constructed levees, water control structures, and delivery ditches to create and sustain wetlands across the majority of the refuge. Mosquito bitten, sunburned, dust-choked men worked non-stop even on 100-degree days to create the refuge.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sacramento/ target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sacramento/</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Sacramento/habitats.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Sacramento/habitats.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
