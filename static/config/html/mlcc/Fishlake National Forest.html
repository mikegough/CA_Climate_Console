Fish Lake, from which the forest takes its name, is considered by many to be the gem of Utah. The largest natural mountain lake in the state, it offers trophy fishing and bird watching. The mountains of the Fishlake are a source of water for many of the neighboring communities and agricultural valleys in the region. Elk, deer, black bear, cougar and moose can be found on the Forest, as well as wild turkey and mountain goats.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fs.usda.gov/fishlake target='_blank'>http://www.fs.usda.gov/fishlake</a></td></tr></table></div>
