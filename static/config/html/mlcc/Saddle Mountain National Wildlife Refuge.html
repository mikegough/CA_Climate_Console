It was named for the east-west running line of hills a few miles to the north, the Saddle Mountains; it doesn t encompass or even abut the Saddle Mountains. (There really is a dip that looks like a saddle.) Saddle Mountain NWR is actually located on the long slope leading up to the mountains, the Wahluke Slope. When the Monument was created, it encompassed Saddle Mountain NWR, the entire Wahluke Slope and part of the Saddle Mountains, including the saddle. For reasons lost to history, the Saddle Mountain NWR became the Saddle Mountain Unit and everything else became the Wahluke Unit, which included our portion of the Saddle Mountains.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Hanford_Reach/Saddle_Mountain.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Hanford_Reach/Saddle_Mountain.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
