The dusky Canada goose is a subspecies of Canada goose that was in a decline in the late 1950's and early 1960's. This was primarily due to earthquakes and floods in its nesting habitat on Alaska's Copper River Delta, and the urbanization of its wintering habitat in the Willamette Valley. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ankeny/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ankeny/about.html</a></td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Photo Credit: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ankeny/about.html target='_blank'>https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Ankeny/about.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
