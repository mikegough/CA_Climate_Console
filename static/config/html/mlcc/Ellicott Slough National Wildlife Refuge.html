Over time more properties were added to the refuge.  The addition of the Calabasas Unit was significant because it supports Santa Cruz long-toed salamander and California red-legged frog breeding sites.  The addition of Harkins Slough Unit provides freshwater habitat for migratory birds.  Because of the sensitive nature of the habitat, the refuge is closed to visitors.</td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/ellicott_slough/ target='_blank'>http://www.fws.gov/refuge/ellicott_slough/</a></td></tr></table></div>
