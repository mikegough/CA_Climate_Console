The desert within this area is vast, about three million acres, and has many unique features. Elevations vary from near sea level, north of Baker, California, to over 6,000 feet, in the Ord Mountains south of Barstow. There are many scenic locations with rough mountains, dry lake beds, and winding canyons. Plants found here include various cactus species and the Joshua Tree, the symbol of the Mojave Desert. Winter days are usually comfortable in the 70 degree F. range (about 20 degree C.), attracting visitors who come to escape colder states. Summer days can be hot and dry, with 110 degree F. (40 degree C.) temperatures common. </td></tr><tr><td><span class='descriptionCategoryLabel'>Link: </span></td><td colspan='2'><a href=http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/barstow.html target='_blank'>http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/fo/barstow.html</a></td></tr></table></div>
