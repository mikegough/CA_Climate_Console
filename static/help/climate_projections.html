<h3 id="aboutClimateData">Climate: </h3>

Climate refers to the statistical properties of weather over periods ranging from months to decades or more, and includes average conditions, and the range of variability, as well as the frequency of extreme events (definition borrowed from <a href="http://pics.uvic.ca/">Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions</a>).
<p>

A climate trend is a progressive change in the state of the climate based on weather statistics evaluated over long periods, typically of at least 30 years (definition borrowed from <a href="http://pics.uvic.ca/">Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions</a>).

Climate data used for the historical period (1971- 2000) correspond to the LT71m PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) 30 arc-second spatial climate dataset for the Conterminous United States (Daly et al. 2008). For future climate projections, we selected 10 climate models, either General Circulation Models (GCMs) or Earth System Models (ESMs), (Table 1) from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5; Taylor et al. 2012). These 10 models were chosen based on evaluations of their ability to simulate historical climate conditions globally and over the southwestern United States, for the specific needs of California water resource planning (O'Daly et al. 2015)

The ten GCM/ESMs capture a wide range of projected changes in both average annual temperature and precipitation (Figure 1) under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5; Meinshausen et al. 2011, van Vuuren et al. 2011). RCP8.5 is a highly energy-intensive scenario that results from high population growth and a moderate rate of technology development without establishment of climate change policies.

We used the downscaled climate projections from the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) U.S. Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX US-DCP30) dataset (Thrasher et al. 2013) for the entire state of California. We chose two thirty-year periods, 2016-2045 and 2046-2075, to represent the projected futures. Each climate model projections were averaged over those periods and a multi-model ensemble mean of the ten model projections was also calculated for each time period.
<p>
 <b>Calculation of Climate Variables</b>
<p>
Climate variable values (tmax, tmin, and prec) were calculated as means of annual average temperatures and of annual total precipitation for each time period (1971-2000, 2016-2045, and 2046-2075) .
<p>
Two derived climate variables, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and aridity(the ratio of annual precipitation over PET), were also calculated for historical and future periods. PET was calculated using the 1985 version of the Hargreaves potential evaporation equation (Hargreaves and Allen 2003):
<p>
PET = 0.0023 x 0.408RA x (Tavg + 17.8) x TD 0.5 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   (1)
<p>
where RA is the extraterrestrial radiation expressed in (MJ m-2 d-1), Tavg (oC) is the average daily temperature, and TD (oC) is the temperature range. The constant 0.408 is the inverse of latent heat flux of vaporization at 20 oC. It is used to convert extraterrestrial radiation units from MJ m-2 d-1 to mm d-1. RA was calculated using the r.sun (Suri & Hofierka 2004) routine in the GRASS geographic information system (GRASS 2015).
<p>
Aridity was defined as P/PET where P is annual precipitation. The percentage change in aridity was calculated by following Feng and Fu's method (2013):
<p>
&Delta;(P/PET)/(P/PET)&asymp;&Delta;P/P-&Delta;PET/PET    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    (2)
<p>
All climate variables for historic and future projections (from ten climate models and one ensemble mean) were calculated from the NetCDF files in the NCAR Command Language (NCL) software program (NCL 2014) and are listed in Table 2.
<p>

<div class="tableDescriptions"> Table 2 Climate variables (maximum temperature - tmax, minimum temperature - tmin, precipitation - prec, and potential evapotranspiration - PET) used in the analysis. Seasons were defined as Winter (October - March) and Summer (April - September). Delta values for the future periods were calculated by subtracting historical values from future values.</div>

The delta or change values between historic and future for minimum and maximum temperature were calculated by subtracting historical values from future values. However, for precipitation and aridity change was calculated as a percent change from the historical (((future-historical) / historical) * 100).

    <b> Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)</b>
    <p>
     Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe future concentrations and emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollutants and land-use change, created by four different international teams using different sets of assumptions. The word 'representative' means that each RCP is only one of many possible scenarios found in the literature. The term 'concentration' is used because atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are the primary simulation product rather than emissions. RCPs are tagged for their radiative forcing target level for year 2100. RCP2.6 is a stringent mitigation scenario that aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures, with radiative forcing peaks near 3 W/m2 before 2100 and then declines. RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are two intermediate stabilization scenarios in which radiative forcing is stabilized at approximately 4.5 W/m2 and 6.0 W/m2 after 2100. RCP8.5 (used here) is a scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions where radiative forcing reaches >8.5 W/m2 by 2100 and continues to rise for some  time. (Van Vuuren et al. 2011; Stocker et al. 2013)

<b>Description of Climate Model Datasets</b>
<p>
The LT71m PRISM dataset is a gridded time series of monthly-modeled values for precipitation (rain + melted snow), maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures. It uses data from station networks that have at least some stations with >= 20 years of observed data. To create a grid with PRISM, Daly et al. (2008) use the climatologically-aided interpolation (CAI) method with 1971-2000 monthly climatologies.
<p>
The NEX US-DCP30 future climate dataset includes climate projections from 34 GCMs that have been statistically downscaled to 30 arc-second spatial resolution using the Bias-Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) method (Maurer and Hidalgo 2008). First the bias in temperature and precipitation projections is corrected by comparing GCM results with "observations" from the PRISM dataset. The projections are then downscaled to the finer 30 arc-second grid using the complex spatial interpolation method during the "spatial-disaggregation" step (Thrasher et al. 2013).
<p>
<b>Climate Data Extraction</b>
<p>
All PRISM data used for the historical period were converted from the ESRI ASCII raster format (ESRI 2014) to the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF; Rew et al. 1997, UNIDATA 2015). We discovered that when the NEX data were processed by Thrasher et al. (2013) the left lower corners of the PRISM data were erroneously used as the center coordinates for processing the NEX NetCDF files. Therefore, the origin of the NEX US-DCP30 data had to be altered to conform to the PRISM data. The NEX grids were adjusted by one-half grid cell (0.004166666667 decimal degrees) so that the two datasets would be spatially aligned and consistent.
<p>
Once all of the data were in the NetCDF format and spatially aligned, climate variables [maximum average monthly temperature (tmax), minimum average monthly temperature (tmin), and average monthly precipitation (prec)] were extracted just for the state of California. The multi-model ensemble was then created for each variable by taking the un-weighted mean of the projections from the ten climate models of interest.
<p>
<b>Post Processing</b>
<p>
Each climate dataset was projected to California Teale Albers (NAD83) using a cubic convolution resampling method in ArcGIS 10.3. The zonal mean for both climate and impact projection datasets was calculated for each of the reporting units and stored in a spatial database which can then be queried against  using the tools provided on the left hand side of the map or by simply clicking on a feature of interest. This allows the user to examine future climate projections and climate change impacts within one or more administrative units or ecological boundaries of interest.
