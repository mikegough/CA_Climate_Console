For the selected area, Climate Departure helps answer the question...

Will the climatic conditions that existed in the past, exist in the future?

Technically, climate departure is a measure of the number of standard deviations the projected future mean is from the historical mean.  

This value, known as a standardized anomaly, is a Z-Score which is calculated as follows:

<img style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto" src="static_climate_console/help/img/ce_equation.png">
</div>
<p>

where d is the difference, xf is the mean of the variable in the future period, xh is the mean of the variable in the historical period, and sxh is the standard deviation of the variable in the historical period. Climate Departure has traditionally been calculated over time for individual raster cells. In this study, we have calculated it over space (within a reporting unit).    
<p>

We then characterize the climate departure for each variable as ranging from "Very Low" to "Very High" using the breaks shown in the table below:  
<p>
<div style="width:100%; text-align:center">
<table class="info_table">
<tr>
<th># of Standard Deviations <br>from the Historical</th><th>Climate Departure</th></tr>
<tr><td> <= 0.5 </td><td>Very Low</td></tr>
<tr><td> <= 1.5 </td><td>Low</td></tr>
<tr><td> <= 2 </td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
<tr><td> <= 2.5 </td><td>High</td></tr>
<tr><td> <= 3 </td><td>Very High</td></tr>

Climate Departure vs. Climate Change 
</div>
<p>

Climate Departure is not the same thing as Climate Change. Although all else being equal, lower levels of climate change will contribute to a lower climate departure value. A climate departure value of "Very Low" should be interpreted to mean that the historical climate conditions that existed in the past in the selected reporting unit are expected to exist in the future somewhere in the same reporting unit, although not necessarily in the same locations within that reporting unit. For example, within a selected county, the temperatures that historically existed at lower elevations, may still exist in the same county in the future, but only at higher elevations. In general, reporting units with higher topographic diversity and lower levels of climate change will tend to have lower climate departure values than flat, topographically homogeneous reporting units with high levels of projected climate change.

The curves that appear in the chart show the distribution of cell values within the selected area for a set of bioclimatic variables for the historical period (1971-2000) as well as two future time periods (2016-2045 and 2046-2075). Two future models were selected, a Hot/Wet model (CanESM2) and a Hot/Dry model (HadGEM2-ES). 
<p>
Where climate departure is high, there will be a large gap between the future and historical curves. Where climate departure is low, there will be more overlap between the future and historical curves.
<p>
The reporting unit illustrated in figure 2 would have a <b>Very High</b> climate departure because the future means deviate significantly from the historical means. In fact, there is no overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. This indicates that the historical climate conditions that existed in the selected reporting unit are not expected to exist in the future.

<span style="font-size:.7em">Figure 2: High Climate Departure</span>
<p>

The reporting unit illustrated in figure 3 would have a <b>Very Low</b> climate departure because there is a significant amount of overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. Where this is the case, the historical climate conditions within the reporting unit are expected to exist in the future (though not necessarily in the same locations within the reporting unit).

<b>Vegetation Data:</b>
<p>
Additionally you can display a curve depicting the amount of land area occupied by a vegetation type across the state of California. Comparing these (orange) curves with the curves for the historical and future bioclimatic variables provides an indication of how future changes in these conditions could change the distribution of that vegetation type. In the example below, the curve for chaparral has significant overlap with historical max and min temp, but less overlap with the future curves for those variables, with temperatures growing warmer than currently conducive for California's chaparral communities. Selecting a vegetation type also displays the distribution of that vegetation type on the map.

We used the CalFire-FRAP 30m California statewide land cover dataset to represent vegetation cover within the study area (CalFire-FRAP 2015). These data were produced by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection from the "best available data" land cover data and were cross-walked to macro-groups based on the Manual of California Vegetation that was used in the 2015 California State Wildlife Action Plan (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2015). 
<p>
We resampled 30m data the map to the approximately 1km (30 arc second) spatial resolution (consistent with the climate data) using a majority filter in Esri's ArcGIS software (ESRI 2014). The data were then converted to the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF; Rew et al. 1997; UNIDATA 2015).
<p>
Afterwards we used the macro-group classification to select the nineteen vegetation types occurring the within the study area (Table 2). Of the thirty-one resampled types only nineteen had a distribution greater than 0.2% or were an upland macro-group and thus were used in the climate exposure analysis.
