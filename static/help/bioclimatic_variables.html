The Climate Departure chart shows the distribution of cell values within the selected area for a set of bioclimatic variables for the historical period (1971-2000) as well as two future time periods (2016-2045 and 2046-2075). Two future models were selected, a Hot/Wet model (CanESM2) and a Hot/Dry model (HadGEM2-ES). 
<p>
Climate departure refers to how different the future climate is expected to be from the historical climate. Where climate departure is high, there will be a large gap between the future and historical curves. Where climate departure is low, there will be more overlap between the future and historical curves.
<p>
The reporting unit illustrated in figure 2 would have a <b>high</b> climate departure because there is no overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. Where this is the case, the future climate in the selected reporting unit is expected to deviate significantly from the historical climate.

The reporting unit illustrated in figure 3 would have a <b>low</b> climate departure because there is a significant amount of overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. Where this is the case, the historical climate conditions within the reporting unit are expected to exist in the future (though not necessarily in the same locations within the reporting unit).
