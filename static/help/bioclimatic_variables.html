Climate Departure is based on the difference between the projected future climate (2016-2045) and the historical climate (1971-2000) within the selected reporting unit(s). The higher the climate departure, the greater the difference the projected climate is from what the area experienced in the past. 
<p>
Climate departure is based on the departure of three climate variables: Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, and Precipitation. For each variable, the standardized anomaly is calculated using the following formula:

where d is the difference, x<sub>f</sub> is the mean of the variable in the future period, x<sub>h</sub> is the mean of the variable in the historical period, and Ïƒ<sub>x<sub>h</sub></sub> is standard deviation of the variable in the historical period. 
<p>
We then take the absolute value of these three differences and then take the mean of these three absolute values in order to capture the average climate departure among the three climate variables.  
<p>
As a final step, we take the natural log of the mean climate departure in order to reduce the influence of outliers.

The Climate Departure chart shows the distribution of cell values within the selected area for a set of bioclimatic variables for the historical period (1971-2000) as well as two future time periods (2016-2045 and 2046-2075).
<p>
Climate departure refers to how different the future climate is expected to be from the historical climate. Where climate departure is high, there will be a large gap between the future and historical curves. Where climate departure is low, there will be more overlap between the future and historical curves.
<p>
The reporting unit illustrated in figure 2 would have a <b>high</b> climate departure because there is no overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. Where this is the case, the future climate in the selected reporting unit is expected to deviate significantly from the historical climate.

The reporting unit illustrated in figure 3 would have a <b>low</b> climate departure because there is a significant amount of overlap between the historical curves and the future curves. Where this is the case, the historical climate conditions within the reporting unit are expected to exist in the future (though not necessarily in the same locations within the reporting unit).
