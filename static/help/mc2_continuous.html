Carbon, Fire, and Water data were simulated with the Dynamic Global Vegetation Model MC2 (<a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2a9TrKD">http://bit.ly/2a9TrKD</a>) at 30 arc-secs. The model was run from 1895-2010 using PRISM historical data, and from 2011-2099 using the bias-corrected spatially downscaled (BCSD) climate futures (Thrasher et al. 2013) for 9 global climate models (because vapor pressure/relative humidity was missing for CMCC-CMS available results, it could not be used by MC2 which requires this input). All climate futures were run with the RCP8.5 emission scenario.

Decadal means of the following MC2 variables are made available:
<p/>

1. net biological production (NBP) (g C m-2 y-1)  which corresponds to primary production minus soil respiration and minus harvest (agriculture or logging) and material lost through fire emission
<p/>
2. total ecosystem carbon (g C m-2) including both herbaceous and woody plant material as well as soil carbon
<p/>
3. forest carbon (g C m-2) including leaves, branches and boles, roots
<p/>
4. dead aboveground carbon (g C m-2) corresponding to litter
<p/>
5. biomass consumed by fire and emitted as gaseous emissions
<p/>
6. stream flow including surface runoff and water that percolated through the soil profile without being evaporated or taken up by plant roots
<p/>
7. climatic water deficit (CWD) which corresponds to the difference between potential and actual evapotranspiration.
