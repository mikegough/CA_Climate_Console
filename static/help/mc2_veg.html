Land cover data were simulated with the Dynamic Global Vegetation Model MC2 (<a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/2a9TrKD">http://bit.ly/2a9TrKD</a>) at 30 arc-secs. The model was run from 1895-2010 using PRISM historical data, and from 2011-2099 using the bias-corrected spatially downscaled (BCSD) climate futures (Thrasher et al. 2013) for 9 global climate models (because vapor pressure/relative humidity was missing for CMCC-CMS available results, it could not be used by MC2 which requires this input). All climate futures were run with the RCP8.5 emission scenario.
<p/>

MC2 vegetation types were aggregated into broader categories listed below:
<p/>
0:undefined
<br>1:taiga/tundra
<br>2:conifer forest
<br>3:mixed forest
<br>4:broadleaf forest
<br>5:shrubland/woodland/savanna
<br>6:grassland
<br>7:arid land
<br>8:annual agriculture
<br>9:perennial agriculture
<br>10:developed/mined

<p/>
The mode of the vegetation cover was calculated for each decade starting in 2011 (2011-2020, 2021-2030, etc). The final decade (2091-2099) ends in 2099 since most climate models were missing data for 2100. 'Year' on the chart corresponds to the start of each decade.
