                    This chart shows results for several fuzzy logic models averaged over the area selected by the user. These models were developed using <a href="https://consbio.org/products/tools/environmental-evaluation-modeling-system-eems" target="_blank"> EEMS</a>, a tree-based, fuzzy logic modeling system developed by Tim Sheehan at CBI.  <p>

In addition, when you click on a column, you'll see the model diagram appear below the chart. The model diagram is an interactive graphical representation of the model used to create each of the EEMS results shown in the chart. The model flows from the bottom up &mdash; meaning that input nodes appear below the output nodes they create. The text in the gray boxes indicate the operation used to combine the input data (e.g., <i>Fuzzy Union</i>).
                <p>
                Clicking on any box makes the corresponding spatial dataset show up on the map. By clicking on the color ramps on the right hand side of each box in the logic tree, the user can choose how to render the data (classified or stretched). When the user clicks on a box, the model diagram expands to show the underlying inputs used to create the box that was selected. Box colors indicate the number of inputs (see color scale below logic tree). The active box representing the map on display will be highlighted in green.

                <h3>Site Sensitivity</h3>
                The Site Sensitivity Model evaluates the study area for factors that make the landscape sensitive to climate change. These factors fall into two main branches of the model: soil sensitivity and water retention potential. As a final step in the model, we defined barren areas as having the lowest possible sensitivity since many of these areas will not be further degraded by climate change.

                    <b>Processing of Soil Data</b>
                <p>
                    All soil variables were downloaded for the conterminous United States and processed in ESRI ArcInfo workstation (ESRI 2014). Polygon data were converted to a raster dataset with a cell size of 0.0083333333 decimal degrees. The data were then clipped to the state of California boundaries and exported in NetCDF format.
                <p>
                    <b>Calculation of Water Erodibility Index</b>
                <p>
                    The index of susceptibility to water erosion (LSKf) was calculated from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (Wischmeier & Smith 1978) which is given as:
                <p>
                    A = R * K * L * S * C * P &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (3)
                <p>
                    where A is predicted average annual soil loss, R is measured rainfall erosivity, K is soil erodibility, L is slope length factor, S is steepness of the slope, and C and P represent the respective erosion reduction effects of management (C) and erosion control practices (P).
                <p>
                    Combining L and S represents the impact of topography on erosion and is calculated as (Hickey 2000):

                <p>
                    LS= (As/22.13)<sup>^0.4</sup>&#8226;(sin?/0.09)<sup>^1.4</sup>&#8226;1.4
                <p>
                    where As is the unit of contributing area (m), ? is the slope in radians. We then combined the K factor with LS to estimate the potential susceptibility of a soil to water erosion.
                <p>

                <h3> Climate Exposure</h3>
                The Climate Exposure Model is based on aridity and climate. Climate factors include maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation on a seasonal basis and an annual basis. Change was calculated for two future time periods, 2016-2045 and 2046-2075, compared to the historical period, 1971-2000. Projections for three climate futures were used along with the ensemble mean values from those models. Temperature and precipitation differences were normalized using the standard deviation over the historical period via the following formula:
                <br>
                <div style="width:100%; text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"> <img style="width:150px;" src="static_climate_console/img/ce_equation.png"></div>
                <br>
                <br>

                where d is the difference, x<sub>f</sub> is the mean of the variable in the future period, x<sub>h</sub> is the mean of the variable in the historical period, and s<sub>x<sub>h</sub></sub> is standard deviation of the variable in the historical period. Change in aridity was calculated as the percent change from the historical period. Projected future change is very high for temperatures and aridity. In order to capture both the differences across the region as well as the severity of change, nonlinear conversions were used to convert input data into fuzzy space:
