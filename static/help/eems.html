    The Condition & Exposure chart shows results for several fuzzy logic models averaged over the area selected by the user. These models were developed using <a href="https://consbio.org/products/tools/environmental-evaluation-modeling-system-eems" target="_blank"> EEMS</a>, a tree-based, fuzzy logic modeling system developed by Tim Sheehan at CBI.  <p>

In addition, when you click on a column, you'll see the model diagram appear below the chart. The model diagram is an interactive graphical representation of the model used to create each of the EEMS results shown in the chart. The model flows from the bottom up &mdash; meaning that input nodes appear below the output nodes they create. The text in the gray boxes indicate the operation used to combine the input data (e.g., <i>Fuzzy Union</i>).
<p>
Clicking on any box makes the corresponding spatial dataset show up on the map. By clicking on the color ramps on the right hand side of each box in the logic tree, the user can choose how to render the data (classified or stretched). When the user clicks on a box, the model diagram expands to show the underlying inputs used to create the box that was selected. Box colors indicate the number of inputs (see color scale below logic tree). The active box representing the map on display will be highlighted in green.
<p>
<h3>Site Sensitivity</h3>
The Site Sensitivity Model evaluates the study area for factors that make the landscape sensitive to climate change. These factors fall into two main branches of the model: soil sensitivity and water retention potential. As a final step in the model, we defined barren areas as having the lowest possible sensitivity since many of these areas will not be further degraded by climate change.

<b>Soil Data for Soil Sensitivity Calculation</b>
<p>
    Soil data for this analysis were obtained from the conterminous United States Multi-Layer Soil Characteristics data (Miller & White 1998) and the STATSGO soil database (Soil Survey Staff 2015). All variables used are listed in Table 3.

    <b>Processing of Soil Data</b>
<p>
    All soil variables were downloaded for the conterminous United States and processed in ESRI ArcInfo workstation (ESRI 2014). Polygon data were converted to a raster dataset with a cell size of 0.0083333333 decimal degrees. The data were then clipped to the state of California boundaries and exported in NetCDF format.
<p>
    <b>Calculation of Water Erodibility Index</b>
<p>
    The index of susceptibility to water erosion (LSKf) was calculated from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (Wischmeier & Smith 1978) which is given as:
<p>
    A = R * K * L * S * C * P &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (3)
<p>
    where A is predicted average annual soil loss, R is measured rainfall erosivity, K is soil erodibility, L is slope length factor, S is steepness of the slope, and C and P represent the respective erosion reduction effects of management (C) and erosion control practices (P).
<p>
    Combining L and S represents the impact of topography on erosion and is calculated as (Hickey 2000):

<p>
    LS= (As/22.13)<sup>^0.4</sup>&#8226;(sin?/0.09)<sup>^1.4</sup>&#8226;1.4
<p>
    where As is the unit of contributing area (m), ? is the slope in radians. We then combined the K factor with LS to estimate the potential susceptibility of a soil to water erosion.
<p>

<h3> Climate Exposure</h3>
The Climate Exposure Model is based on aridity and climate. Climate factors include maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation on a seasonal basis and an annual basis. Change was calculated for two future time periods, 2016-2045 and 2046-2075, compared to the historical period, 1971-2000. Projections for three climate futures were used along with the ensemble mean values from those models. Temperature and precipitation differences were normalized using the standard deviation over the historical period via the following formula:
<br>
<div style="width:100%; text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"> <img style="width:150px;" src="http://climateconsole.org/static_climate_console/img/ce_equation.png"></div>
<br>
<br>

where d is the difference, x<sub>f</sub> is the mean of the variable in the future period, x<sub>h</sub> is the mean of the variable in the historical period, and s<sub>x<sub>h</sub></sub> is standard deviation of the variable in the historical period. Change in aridity was calculated as the percent change from the historical period. Projected future change is very high for temperatures and aridity. In order to capture both the differences across the region as well as the severity of change, nonlinear conversions were used to convert input data into fuzzy space:

<h3>Terrestrial Intactness</h3>
Terrestrial intactness is based on the extent to which human impacts such as agriculture, urban development, natural resource extraction, and invasive species have disrupted the landscape across the State of California. Terrestrial intactness values are high in areas where these impacts are low.
<p>
This dataset, updated December 2016, is the most recent version (v30) created for the California Energy Commission using the open-source logic modeling framework Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS). Spatially-explicit logic modeling hierarchically integrates numerous and diverse datasets into composite layers, quantifying information in a continuous rather than binary fashion. This technique yields accessible decision-support products that state and federal agencies can use to craft scientifically-rigorous management strategies. The analysis was carried out at 1 sq. km resolution.
<p>
Input data used to create this version range in currency from 2011-2015; the majority of data portray the more recent condition of the landscape.
<p>
This model integrates agriculture development (from FRAP Vegetation, and CDL Cropscape), urban development (from LANDFIRE EVT and NLCD Impervious Surfaces), polluted areas (from NHD treatment ponds and EPA Superfund and Brownfield sites), linear development (OHV routes from owlsheadgps.com, roads from TIGER (broken down by type), utility lines, railroads, and pipelines from various state and BLM sources), point development (communication towers from the FCC), energy and mining development (from the state's Office of Mine Reclamation mine dataset, larger mine footprints, state geothermal wells, USGS wind turbines, solar footprints, renewable projects in development, oil refineries and state oil/gas wells), clear cuts from Statewide Timber Harvest Plans, invasive vegetation (compiled from multiple sources including LANDFIRE EVT, NatureServe Landcover, and NISIMS BLM database), and measures of natural vegetation fragmentation calculated using FRAGSTATS (percent natural core area, number of patches, and nearest neighbor). Results are dependent on the quality of available input data for a given area.
<p>
This most recent version of the model (v30) addresses over-estimation of fragmentation impacts seen in previous versions (e.g. v24), which stemmed from invasive vegetation and fire effects in FRAGSTATS calculations. New fragmentation metrics shift focus to anthropogenic development. Invasive vegetation is now compartmentalized within the logic model and influences the overall impact/condition score to a lesser extent. Additional model refinements stratify road impacts by TIGER class, e.g. different weighting for interstates vs. local roads.
<p>
Results apply to terrestrial areas only. (Water bodies are omitted from the final dataset.)
<p>
The input data, intermediate layers, and final results of this analysis can be explored via the EEMS Explorer of Data Basin (http://databasin.org/), where they are accessible as online interactive maps showing the signature of human impact across the landscape.
<p>
Caution is warranted in interpreting this dataset because it provides a single estimate of terrestrial intactness based on available data. It does not directly address ecological value; the "Conservation Values" model does. The degree of terrestrial intactness likely varies for a particular species or conservation element, and may depend on additional factors or thresholds not included in this model. This model should be taken as a general measure of intactness that can serve as a template for evaluating across many species at the ecoregion scale, and provides a framework within which species-specific parameters can be incorporated for more detailed analyses.
