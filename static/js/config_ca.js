    description:"Terrestrial intactness is an estimate of current condition based on the extent to which human impacts such as agriculture, urban development, natural resource extraction, and invasive species have disrupted the landscape across the DRECP study area. Terrestrial intactness values will be high in areas where these impacts are low. <p>The value shown in the column chart represents the average terrestrial intactness value within the selected area. Terrestrial intactness values are calculated using an <a target='_blank' href=http://consbio.org/products/tools/environmental-evaluation-modeling-system-eems>EEMS</a> fuzzy logic model that integrates multiple measures of landscape development and vegetation intactness (See EEMS model diagram below). <p>  This model integrates agriculture development (from LANDFIRE EVT v1.1), urban development (from LANDFIRE EVT v1.1 and NLCD Impervious Surfaces), linear development (from Tiger 2012 Roads, utility lines, and pipelines), OHV recreation areas, energy and mining development (from state mine and USGS national mines datasets as well as geothermal wells, oil/gas wells, wind turbines, and power plant footprints), vegetation departure (from LANDFIRE VDEP), invasive vegetation (multiple sources combined for invasives analyses), and measures of natural vegetation fragmentation calculated using FRAGSTATS. In this version, Maxent modeled Sahara Mustard was included in the Invasive's branch as well as in the Fragstats model run. <div class='modelDiagram' style='height:70%'><img src='" + static_url + "img/modelDiagrams/Terrestrial_Intactness/Slide1.PNG'><img src='" + static_url + "img/modelDiagrams/Terrestrial_Intactness/Slide2.PNG'><div class='bottom_spacing'><p></div></div>",
